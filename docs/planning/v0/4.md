So you suggested we divide the `.env` files up for each node. I think this is a good idea. But I want to do this in a way that makes it easy for random users to get started, since I am open sourcing this.

So I am thinking we should have a single `example.env` file that has all the variables in it.
when the user clones the repo, they can just copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and then fill in the values.

something like this:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

and then we will have a `setup.sh` script that will break down the `.env` file into the individual `.env` files for each node.

So we will end up with something like this:

```txt
.env
src/master_node/.env
src/worker_node/.env
src/ollama_node/.env
```

for #2, as you suggested I will be changing the `src/master_node/services/step_ca/Dockerfile` to use a `Debian` slim image with `step-ca` installed on the Debian container instead of the `smallstep/step-ca` image.

This will make it easier to copy the `config/smallstep_ca.json` file to the container and use it as the CA configuration.
