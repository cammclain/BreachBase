So you suggested we divide the `.env` files up for each node. I think this is a good idea. But I want to do this in a way that makes it easy for random users to get started, since I am open sourcing this.

So I am thinking we should have a single `example.env` file that has all the variables in it.
when the user clones the repo, they can just copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and then fill in the values.

something like this:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

and then we will have a `setup.sh` script that will break down the `.env` file into the individual `.env` files for each node.

So we will end up with something like this:

```txt
.env
src/master_node/.env
src/worker_node/.env
src/ollama_node/.env
```

for #2, as you suggested I will be changing the `src/master_node/services/step_ca/Dockerfile` to use a `Debian` slim image with `step-ca` installed on the Debian container instead of the `smallstep/step-ca` image.

This will make it easier to copy the `config/smallstep_ca.json` file to the container and use it as the CA configuration.

for #3 I have started to work on the `src/worker_node/services/scanner/application/app/scans/hosts.py`, and the `src/worker_node/services/scanner/application/app/scans/discovery/scans.py` file.

These look like this:



`src/worker_node/services/scanner/application/app/scans/hosts.py`

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from temporalio import workflow

from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Service:
    port: int
    protocol: str

@dataclass
class Host:
    ip: str
    port: int
    protocol: str
    services: list[Service]


@workflow.defn(name="ScanHosts")
class ScanHosts:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self) -> None:
        pass





```


and `src/worker_node/services/scanner/application/app/scans/discovery/scans.py`

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from temporalio import activity
from bbot.scanner import Scanner
from app.scans.hosts import Host

@activity.defn(name="PortScan")
async def port_scan(self, host: Host) -> None:
    scanner: Scanner = Scanner()
    scanner.scan(host.ip)

    return scanner.results


@activity.defn(name="ServiceScan")
async def service_scan(self, host: Host) -> None:
    pass



@activity.defn(name="VulnScan")
async def vuln_scan(self, host: Host) -> None:
    pass


```

I also added a `src/worker_node/services/scanner/application/main.py` file that has a `main` function that will start the Temporal worker.
